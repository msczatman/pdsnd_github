# Project Bike Share Data
__This project is a python based project.__

Data included in .csv files are related to bike share systems for three big  cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City and Washington.

We can explore data using python language.

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are there for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:


>_Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)_

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

> _Gender
Birth Year_


The Statistics is created to draw insights from the data given.

\* Please note: numpy and pandas libraries are used in the project to enhance statistics obtained from the data.\*
